## Features

- **Real-time Morse code decoding** using deep learning
- **Robust decoding** for weak signals, QSB, and noisy conditions
- **Multi-channel decoding** for handling multiple CW signals
- **SO2R stereo decoding** with the left radio on channel 0 and right radio on channel 1
- **Audio pass-through** with deep-learning-based noise reduction
- **Cross-platform support** for Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS

## Run locally

Install the JavaScript dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local URL printed by Vite, normally
<http://localhost:5173/>. The development and production build commands
automatically download the pinned public English model from
[deepcw-engine](https://github.com/e04/deepcw-engine) and verify its SHA-256
checksum before starting.

To check the model independently:

```bash
npm run models:verify
```

This verifies the published metadata, parses the ONNX protobuf, and runs a real
inference. It is also a useful diagnostic if the page reports a model-loading
error.

The browser keeps the existing 9.6 kHz capture path. Immediately before
inference, each isolated channel is converted with the model's published
settings: 3.2 kHz linear resampling, centered 256-sample Hann frames, 48-sample
hop, 400–1200 Hz / 65 bins, and `log1p` magnitude normalization.

The public engine distribution currently includes the standard English model.
Pileup mode and Japanese decoding remain visible but disabled because their
separate models are not publicly distributed with the engine. Normal,
Benchmark, and SO2R modes use the verified English model.

## SO2R stereo input

Select **SO2R** mode to decode two radios from one stereo capture device. DeepCW
requests and verifies a two-channel input, then keeps the channels isolated:

- channel 0 / left: **LEFT RADIO**
- channel 1 / right: **RIGHT RADIO**

Each radio has its own scope, decode band, bandwidth, window, live decode, and
streaming transcript. The inference engine is shared. Audio THRU is disabled in
SO2R mode so monitoring cannot accidentally combine the channels.

On macOS, configure the radio or audio interface as a two-channel input in
**Audio MIDI Setup**, route the left radio to input 1 and the right radio to
input 2. If the input list is initially empty, click **START** once and grant
microphone access. Select the interface under **STEREO INPUT**, then click
**START** again to begin decoding. Confirm that DeepCW reports two captured
channels and the expected sample rate.

## DeepCW Engine

DeepCW's CW decoding model and reference implementation are available as a separate repository:

https://github.com/e04/deepcw-engine

It includes the model, metadata, and Python/Node.js examples for decoding Morse code from WAV audio.

## Benchmark

- Results are from balanced mode.
- SNR is measured over a 2500 Hz bandwidth.
- Error rate is reported as CER (Character Error Rate), defined as the percentage of inserted, deleted, or substituted characters relative to the reference text.

It achieves 0.00% error from 0 to -4 dB SNR at all tested speeds, and remains nearly error-free at -6 dB.

Even under weak-signal conditions, performance degrades gracefully: errors stay below 1.5% at -8 dB and below 8% at -10 dB across the full speed range.

### Comparison with Other Decoders

To provide context for DeepCW’s performance, we compared it with several established CW decoding tools: [CW Skimmer,](https://www.dxatlas.com/CwSkimmer/) [fldigi,](https://www.w1hkj.org/) and [ggmorse](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggmorse).

These projects have made valuable contributions to the amateur-radio and Morse-code software ecosystem. The comparison below is not intended as a general ranking of these applications; it reflects only the specific test clips, settings, and evaluation method used in this README.　

All tested software was the latest available version as of June 3, 2026.

To evaluate performance under real-world conditions, we compared DeepCW with other decoders using publicly available short CW QSO videos from YouTube.

## Noise Reduction

DeepCW includes a real-time, deep-learning-based noise reduction feature designed specifically for CW signals.

In addition to decoding Morse code, DeepCW can pass the audio through a neural noise reduction model, making noisy CW signals easier to monitor by ear.
